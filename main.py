  Your machine learning model has predicted that a customer with the surname {surname} has a {round(probability*100, 1)}% probability of churning, based on the information
  provided below.

  Here is the customer's information: {input_dict}

  Here are the machine learning model's most important features for predicting churn in descending order:

    {df[df['Exited'] == 1].describe()}

    Here are summary statistics for non-churned customers:
    {df[df['Exited'] == 0].describe()}

    
    Base your response on the following criteria depending on the churn probability:
    - If the customer has over 40% risk of churning, generate a brief maximum 3 sentence explanation of why they are at risk of churning.
    - If the customer has less than 40% risk of churning, generate a brief maximum 3 sentence explanation of why they are not at risk of churning.
    - Your explanation should be base on the customer's information, the summary statistics of churned and non-churned customers, and the machine learning model's most important features as provided.
    - Your explanation should not include any other properties of the customers, other than the ones mentioned.

    Don't mention the probability of churning, or the machine learning model, or say anything like "Based on the machine learning model's predictions and the most important features ...", just explain the prediction.
